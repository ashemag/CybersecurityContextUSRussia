# CybersecurityContextUSRussia
This project aims to mitigate the consequences of false attribution and ensuing crisis escalation between the U.S. and Russia.

used between English and Russian speakers. It is a contribution to a broader thesis that establishes a 
foundation for understanding the differences in how English and Russian speakers contextualize cybersecurity.
